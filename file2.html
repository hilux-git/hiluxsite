<p>i miss you victor, i can't finish it. i tried, and look what this website is now. it's a mess. i've gone crazy</p>
<p>there's so much stupid stuff. you were the guy that did the code, i was the business guy. i don't know enough</p>
<p>i hope you hear this vic, don't be dissappointed, i guess this sit is just how i cope now. it's not the</p>
<p>master plan we had dream of years ago. i miss all the memories of running lmpi. we almost got to have that</p>
<p>again. i miss you man, i'll be okay, i'm gonna continue to use the site as a coping strat. I have a backup</p>
<p>on the hard drive that's not on the internet of the original hiluxsite in your memory</p>
<p>miss you, -me</p>

<p>emily, why. why him, why not me. it's stupid i want to <!-- cry -->[redacted], but why, i've never met you, why do i care.</p>
<p>i barely even know your voice. i'm scared to try, i dont want to scare you or come off as a stalker.</p>
<p>i'm gonna look back on this and think about how dumb it is and get embarassed by myself.</p>
<p>nobody else is attractive, i just don't see it. i'll get over it, i'll forget about you. but what if i don't?</p>
<p>makayla took 8 years, and i still think about her. i suppose i did meet her and we had a relationship.</p>
<p>that's something we dont have. i feel stupid even thinking of you, weird i guess is a better word.</p>
<p>we're strangers, but i dream of you.</p>
<p>i'm fake, my skills are dumb, this website is dumb. i strive off of others knowledge, and even then it's half ass.</p>
<p>this website is dumb, i need to be a "victor" not what i am, but i don't want to take the time.</p>
<p>maybe that's an excuse, maybe i'm just dumb and don't want to admit it. i feel like a child, this is dumb</p>
<p>i'm gonna stop now, maybe i'll be back, but i want to stop before i realize too much about myself. bye for now.</p>

<p>i want to use it as i intended but i will have to come off innocent and not let them know.</p>   
<p>they probably won't think much of it anyway, possily even glance over it.</p>    
<p>i want to use it better, i can make a use of it. can i? i think so.</p> 
<p>i speak only to myself anymore, why have i let myself do this, why have i come to this.</p>
