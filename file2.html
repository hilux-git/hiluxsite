<p>Arleigh, I know you'll never read this, but I just want to express how important what we have is to me.</p>
    <p>I've never met anyone in my whole life like you, let alone a girl. I've given up on women, I've never been able to say</p>
    <p>that I've met a woman I could actually see myself with. For years, women have all been the same. Be overly friendly, lead me on</P>
    <p>then either fall in love with some other guy who is going to hurt you, or friend zone me. I feel like God really might have</p>
    <p>put us together for a reason. What are the chances in a world where everyone is brain-washed and marching to the beat</p>
    <p>of the media and the worldly sins we have inveloped ourselves in, that there would be a woman that was determined by an algortihm</p>
    <p>to see a video I made, and have the same beliefs as me in nearly every aspect of life. I really think there is a reason we met.</p>
    <p>I have bad judgement skills, I don't know if I make a move or not. We are still in the talking phase, It might be too dangerous</p>
    <p>to tell you how I feel, but I don't want to miss my chance. I want to see you on Saturday. Two hours is not that much when it comes</p>
    <p>down to a woman that might actually be the woman I marry. I just have to be sure. You posted a picture of you and tha other guy this week</p>
    <p>I hate to say it, but I cried. That hurt. I talked with you about him, and I believe you, you've never lied to me, but there is also</p>
    <p>that other guy on your SnapChat that you are best friends with. I really hope you feel the same way about me as I do you. You fell asleep</p>
    <p>tonight while I started to open up, and show emotion in hopes to be attractive, while it hurt a little, and is the real reason I am writing this</p>
    <p>right now, I can't blame you. You told me you were tired. On paper this sounds bad for me, it sounds like it's obvious you aren't interested</p>
    <p>but I believe things can still work out. You are everything, and I mean absolutly everything I have ever looked for. I was hopeless that</p>
    <p>anyone like you actually existed. I don't want to lose you, or let you slip out of my reach. I'm obsessed with you. Goodnight Arleigh</p>
