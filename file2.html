<p>emily, why. why him, why not me. it's stupid i want to cry, but why, i've never met you, why do i care.</p>
<p>i barely even know your voice. i'm scared to try, i dont want to scare you or come off as a stalker.</p>
<p>i'm gonna look back on this and think about how dumb it is and get embarassed by myself.</p>
<p>nobody else is attractive, i just don't see it. i'll get over it, i'll forget about you. but what if i don't?</p>
<p>makayla took 8 years, and i still think about her. i suppose i did meet her and we had a relationship.</p>
<p>that's something we dont have. i feel stupid even thinking of you, weird i guess is a better word.</p>
<p>we're strangers, but i dream of you.</p>
<p>i'm fake, my skills are dumb, this website is dumb. i strive off of others knowledge, and even then it's half ass.</p>
<p>this website is dumb, i need to be a "victor" not what i am, but i don't want to take the time.</p>
<p>maybe that's an excuse, maybe i'm just dumb and don't want to admit it. i feel like a child, this is dumb</p>
<p>i'm gonna stop now, maybe i'll be back, but i want to stop before i realize too much about myself. bye for now.</p>
